# Privacy Policy

Mine Control records no personally identifable information. Any user is considered entirely anonymous, and no information regarding any user is necessary to use the application, nor is there any place to enter any such information.

Mine Control requires server information, including the RCON password, for it to work. This data is stored on-device in the application data, and is never transferred off-device. You, the user, can choose to remove any server configuration at any time. Deleted configurations are not retained by Mine Control and cannot be restored.

There are no 1st or 3rd party services used within Mine Control - only the target Minecraft server specified.
